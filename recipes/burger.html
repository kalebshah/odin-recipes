    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>2 shallots, chopped (⅔ cup)</li>
        <li>16 ounces mushrooms, mix of shiitake + portobello, stemmed and diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tamari</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mirin, or ½ teaspoon maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sriracha, more if desired</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>¼ cup ground flaxseed</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked short-grain brown rice, freshly cooked so that it’s sticky*</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, divided</li>
        <li>Vegan Worcestershire sauce, for brushing</li>
        <li>Nonstick cooking spray, for grilling</li>
        <li>Hamburger buns and desired burger fixings</li>
        <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and sauté until soft, 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and a generous pinch of salt, and sauté until soft and browned, 6 to 9 minutes, turning down the heat slightly, as needed.</li>
    <li>Stir in the tamari, vinegar, and mirin. Stir, reduce the heat, then add the garlic, smoked paprika, and sriracha. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool slightly.</li>
    <li>In a food processor, combine the sautéed mushrooms, walnuts, flaxseed, brown rice, and ½ cup of the panko. Pulse until just combined. The mixture should hold together when pinched, but it should still have some texture.</li>
    <li>Transfer to a large bowl and fold in the remaining panko.</li>
    <li>Form into 8 patties, place them on a large plate, and chill in the fridge for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>If you're grilling the patties, preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Brush the patties with olive oil and spray the grill with cooking spray. Place the patties on the grill and use a spatula to press down lightly. Grill for 7 minutes on the first side, flip, and grill for 6 to 7 minutes on the second side, or until well-charred and cooked through.</li>
    <li>Alternately, cook the patties on the stove. Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Coat the bottom of the skillet with oil and cook the patties for 5 to 6 minutes per side, or until well-charred and cooked through.</li>
    </ol>
